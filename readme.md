Tree-sitter `hjkl` mode

## Usage
Toggle into `tshjkl` mode, then use `hjkl` to change scope or select a sibling node. Toggle is mapped to `<M-v>` (`Alt-v`) and nodes are visually selected by default. Toggle, movement keys, extmark highlights and select mode can be configured - check [init.lua](lua/tshjkl/init.lua) to see configuration and defaults.

### Example
Unwrapping a function  
- toggle with cursor over the inner body
- change scope if you need to
- `d`
- toggle the node to replace
- `p`

`v` â€” visual select the current node (if `config.select_current_node` is false)  
`b` â€” visual select backwards  

`h` â€” parent  
`j` â€” next sibling  
`k` â€” previous sibling  
`l` â€” child  

`H` â€” top-most parent  
`J` â€” last sibling  
`K` â€” first sibling  
`L` â€” inner-most child  


## Motivation
This plugin makes it easier to work with tree-sitter nodes - I've found it often surprising which node is under the cursor so I want to make navigating nodes as easy as basic navigation in Neovim. Visual select by default lets you do normal operations without too much extra thought - this just helps you easily select the node you're interested in.
